# LLM Convo
***`I have no idea what I'm doing it was the LLMs I swear`***

I used 2 (later 3) LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and chatgpt-4o-latest (later locally running Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct)) to write an app that would let 2 LLMs with openai compatible api endpoints talk to each other. I have zero experience with python. After running out of daily allowance on both Anthropic and OpenAI I got what's in this repo more or less. Was more of an experiment if I can make an app without any experience more than anything else. I used [open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) as frontend to "develop" this.

_edit: I successfully managed to implement some stuff while continuing the conversation in [open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) with locally running [Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF) in [koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)_

The *almost* whole conversation exported to pdf: [chat-LLM Convo development.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17450061/chat-LLM.Convo.development.pdf)
*(I had to remove posts with pictures as I was running out of quota and later using model which could not ingest images. So if there is a jarring disconnect or a missing reply it was a reply with picture.)*

# TESTED with [koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), [LM Studio](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai)

- Dark/Light theme
- Number of Exchanges between 3 and 30
- Streaming/interrupting of responses
- Endpoint addresses and System prompts are stored in browser Local Storage
- Timestamps, model names, tokens/second - oh my!
- (Optional) different system prompt for each endpoint
- Buttons change colors with state

Involving in third LLM (locally running Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-Q6_K_L.gguf) I was able to bribe it with enough *virtual head pats* to implement sending of the whole conversation with the prompt. Previously the models would only directly respond to the other models last output. Now they "remember".

I used the following system prompt for both while testing:
```
You are an AI with a distinct personality. Respond naturally to the given prompt, as if in a real conversation. Keep your reply focused and concise, ideally around 50-75 words. Don't continue the conversation beyond your response or roleplay as anyone else. Engage with the topic, add your perspective, or ask a relevant question, but always conclude your response naturally. Avoid overly formal or flowery language - aim for a casual, friendly tone.
```

To try it out in docker:
```
git clone https://github.com/hugalafutro/llm-convo.git
cd llm-convo
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```


Check docker logs `docker compose logs -f`:
```

```


- Visit `http://0.0.0.0:5234`
- If using [koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) enter the Endpoint address in format `http://address:port/v1` i.e. `http://192.168.1.163:5001/v1`
- If using [LM Studio](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai) enter the Endpoint address in format `http://address:port` i.e. `http://192.168.1.163:5001`
- press Connect Endpoint button.
- You should get an popup connection succesful and the Endpoint button will turn green.
- Once both Endpoint buttons are green it's go time.
- Write the Intial Prompt in the bottom text input area and click the Send button.
- ???
- Profit.
